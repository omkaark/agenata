# Agenata - Build Web Datasets with Ease

Agenata is a utility tool to help collect web interaction data which can then be used to finetune models for better web agency. The data produced are in JSONL format which can later go through post-processing to be suitable for your DOM optimizations.

This is an offline app .a.k.a no data is sent/received to any server, all data produced is stored locally.

The current version is basic but the app will soon be highly usable as we account for edge cases. Feedback is more than welcome (open a github issue)!
